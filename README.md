# RandomPotionsGenerator üêâ
A simple UI to generate random D&amp;D potions

[RandomPotionsGenerator.github.io](https://matteorizzo96.github.io/RandomPotionsGenerator.github.io/)

## How it works
The user interaction is simple: you press the button and a potion effect is provided. On a coding level, the potion effect generation is just the randomic extraction of one of many effects stored in a JSON file.
